### Introduction:

There are two issues to be addressed: what to share and how to share.
- What to share:feature-based, instance-based and parameter-based.
- How to share:feature learning approach and deep learning approach(there are five main approaches: low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach, dirty approach and multi-level approach).


### MTL ALGORITHMS

#### Feature Learning Approach
- feature transformation approach:the learned representation is a linear or nonlinear transformation of the original representation
- feature selection approach:selects a subset of the original features as the learned representation and hence the learned representation is similar to the original one by eliminating useless features based on different criteria

#### Low-Rank Approach

#### Task Clustering Approach

#### Task Relation Learning Approach

#### Dirty Approach

#### Multi-Level Approach

#### Deep Learning Approach
