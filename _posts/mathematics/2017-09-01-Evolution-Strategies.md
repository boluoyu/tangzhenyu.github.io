### Black Box Optimization

Consider the unconstrained optimization in continuous domain

where f(x) is called the objective function, whose analytical expression is unknown.The gradient information is unavailable, and the only information accessible is the objective value for any given point. The objective function behaves as a black box, hence above equation is termed black box optimization problems.The objective of continuous black box optimization is to find a solution $$x \in R^n$$ such that its objective value is as good as possible

In black box optimization, the function evaluation is considered to be costly, and the cost of search algorithms is measured by the number of function evaluations. Thus, the goal of black box optimization is to find an approximation to the optimum as close as possible, while keeping the number of function evaluations as small as possible.
