## Pyramid Scene Parsing Network

**Main contributions:**

- Proposed a pyramid scene parsing network to embed difficult scenery context features in an FCN based pixel prediction framework.
- Developed an effective optimization strategy for deep ResNet based on deeply supervised loss.
- Built a practical system for state-of-the-art scene parsing and semantic segmentation where all crucial implementation details are included.

**Several common issues for complex-scene parsing:**

- Mismatched Relationship
- Confusion Categories
- Inconspicuous Classes

Above problems are as follows:
