**Black-box optimization**
- Bayesian Optimization(BO):BO methods always contain a component that aims at the exploration of the space
- Derivative Free Optimization(DFO):DFO methods are content with a local optimum.DFO methods tend to escape shallow local minima and are quite well suited for problems with a few well defined local basins.
- Random Search:
