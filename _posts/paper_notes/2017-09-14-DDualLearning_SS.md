## Deep Dual Learning for Semantic Image Segmentation[[Paper]](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~pluo/pdf/luoWLWiccv17.pdf)

This paper proposed a system named Dual Image Segmentation(DIS) to solve semantic segmentation tasks,which utilize training samples of per-pixel labelmaps and some training samples of image-level tags,and get preferable results.

Definition:
- I:input image
- L:ground-truth labelmap of pixel mark
- T:image tags
- w:weak-mark just image label
- f:full-mark,pixel level label
