### Amazing CNN Architecture

#### 1.Is convolution only in a same group? => Group convolution

#### 2.Is the more bigger kernal better performance? => 3*3 convolutional kernal

#### 3.Is every convolutional layer should have the same kernal size convolutional kernal? => Inception architecture

#### 4.How to reduce the parameter of the convolutional layer? => Bottleneck

#### 5.Is the network deeper and harder to train? => Residual Network

#### 6.Should consider both regions and channels in convolution operation? => DepthWise Operation

#### 7.Random group convolution for channels? => ShuffleNet

#### 8.The weight of channels should be diverse => SENet

#### 9.Make fixed size convolutional kernal having bigger receptive field => Dilated convolution

#### 10.The shape of convolution kernal not need to be rectangle => Deformable convolution
