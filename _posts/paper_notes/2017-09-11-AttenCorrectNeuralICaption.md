# Attention Correctness in Neural Image Captioning

**Paper Link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09553**

This paper focus on evaluating and improving the correctness of attention in neural image captioning models,and propose a quantitative evaluation metric for the consistency between the generated attention maps and human annotations, using recently released datasets with alignment between regions in images and entities in captions.
