# MDNet: A Semantically and Visually Interpretable Medical Image Diagnosis Network

**Paper Link:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02485.pdf**

In clinical practice,making machine to assist the doctor in judging is a very significant thing,in this case,the ouputs of machine should be understanded by doctors.In other words,the machine should make presentation in a natural language way that doctors can understand,then infer the last diagnostic report.The ability is what the existing tachnology lacked.

On the other hand,in the imaging diagnosis of many diseases,it is essential to provide supplementary advice to doctors to help them make decision.

It is the first study to develop an interpretable attention-based model that can explicitly simulate the medical (pathology) image diagnosis process

The main contributions of this paper is presenting a unified network,namely MD-Net,that can read images,generate diagnostic reports,retrieve images by symptom descriptionss,and visualize network attention,to provide justifications of the network diagnosis process.

The network architecture of MDNet is as follows:

A complete medical diagnostic report describes multiple symptoms of observing images,so transform complete report generation problem as a parallel fitting of multiple feature description(using batch shuffle in training process),let every LSTM block focus mining discriminative information from a specific description.

To make different sentence tasks sharing LSTM parameters,MDNet design a conditonal input to LSTM block,that appoint which type of image description of the LSTM output of every sample in a batch.

Original attention echanism is more difficult to train,which often generate attention maps that smoothly highlight the majority of image area.

# Experimental Results:
This paper raise a new definitive evaluation metric,called diagnostic conclusion accuracy (DCA).

1)Quantitative analysis of generating report quality(Table1).

2)Accuracy analysis of diagnosis(Table1).

3)Experiemtns of image retrieval based on image feature desciption,using state-of-art image caption method(NeuralTalk2) as a baseline.
